	"ABOUT_CONTENT": "<h1 id=\"about\">About</h1>\n<p>The Citizen Initiative Portal rahvaalgatus.ee enables you to write proposals, hold discussions, compose and send digitally signed collective addresses to the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu). At rahvaalgatus.ee you can submit a proposal to the Riigikogu on how to amend existing regulations or improve the society. A collective address should have at least 1000 signatures in support, given by at least 16 year old citizens of Estonia. At rahvaalgatus.ee you can follow the proceeding of the address in the parliament and whether it will become a draft act.</p>\n<p>Collective petitioning right emerged from the People’s Assembly process – since 2014 spring every citizen can send collective initiatives to the Parliament for consideration. According to the law (), the Parliament will have to process appeals that have at least 1000 signatures. During the period from spring 2014 until beginning of 2018, the Parliament has processed 16 collective initiatives (link in Estonian) and two of them have been made into laws.</p>\n<p>Who should use rahvaalgatus.ee?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>citizens interested in societal issues for creating discussions and initiatives<br />\n</li>\n<li>advocacy organisations for creating discussions and initiatives</li>\n<li>citizens interested in participating in discussions and in co-creating collective initiatives</li>\n<li>people willing to support initiatives with their digital signature</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who else benefits from rahvaalgatus.ee?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>members of the Riigikogu and other politicians in order to keep up with discussions being held and proposals being submitted</li>\n<li>representatives of ministries in order to keep up with propositions made in their fields<br />\n</li>\n<li>journalists for reflecting on discussions and initiatives gaining big public attention, also for following the political discussions in the parliament</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rahvaalgatus.ee portal will be created by the Estonian Cooperation Assembly in close cooperation with the Chancellery of the Riigikogu. The portal is created on the freeware for community decision-making — CitizenOS.com — which is set up by the foundation Lets Do It! The citizen initiative portal is one of the activities in the Estonian Action Plan 2016-2018 of the Open Government Partnership.</p>\n<h1 id=\"terms-of-using-the-rahvaalgatus.ee-platform\"><a id=\"tos\"></a> Terms of using the rahvaalgatus.ee platform</h1>\n<p>Rahvaalgatus.ee is meant for co-creating proposals and submitting them to the Parliament of Estonia.

The list of persons who have granted their endorsement signatures is visible to the author(s) of the initiative after termination of voting time, at which point the authors’ body can download the container with digital signatures, and to authorised employees of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu who shall ensure that digital signatures have been given by permanent residents of Estonia who are at least 16 years of age.</p>\n<p>Rahvaalgatus.ee does not yet publicly display the endorsing signatories, although such a technical development is planned in the interest of transparency.
