## What can digital signatures be used for?

- It is needed, for example, **to register the place of residence** [in the e-population register](https://www.rahvastikuregister.ee/) (young people may need it during their university studies if their place of residence changes), which is important because several public services (e.g. free public transport) are related to the place of residence.
- You can also submit your **income declaration** to the [Tax and Customs Board](https://www.emta.ee/et) (for example, to get income tax discount on tuition fees).
- You can see your **health data** (including referrals, test results and medical records) in the [Patient Portal](https://www.digilugu.ee) 
- Digital identity is needed to **vote electronically** in the elections and for submitting or signing a collective appeal addressed to the Parliament or local government. 
- You can see which other e-services can be used on the [Estonian State Portal](https://www.eesti.ee/et/) eesti.ee.
