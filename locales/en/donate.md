## Contribute to Keep Signing Free of Charge
In nine out of ten cases, people use paid [Mobiil-ID](https://www.skidsolutions.eu/price-list/#mobile-id) or [Smart-ID](https://www.skidsolutions.eu/price-list/#smart-id) services for signing. Only thanks to donors can rahvaalgatus.ee offer this service to everyone for free. The cost of a signature for rahvaalgatus.ee depends on the number of signatures collected during the month - generally, 1â‚¬ allows for approximately 10 digital signatures.

For the [Estonian Cooperation Assembly](https://kogu.ee/rahvaalgatusveeb), it's important to ensure the widest possible availability of the service. So far, this has been made possible by donations and government support, but in 2024, the costs of digital signing have grown faster than donations.
Although by law, an initiative with 1000 signatures is equivalent to one with 50,000 signatures for the Parliament, [the impact of large support](https://kogu.ee/ekk-ja-sitra-vordlev-raport/) as a catalyst for public debate should not be underestimated. 
Here, everyone can contribute to ensure that in the future, it will be possible to create initiatives that gain significant public attention and bring ideas to politicians!

## Background
Rahvaalgatus.ee platform was set up with public funds, but we need user support to keep it running. Donations of any size are helpful, whether it's 5, 50, or 500 euros. The collected money helps cover costs associated with digital signing and ensures technical support and security in the environment. Transparency is important to us: we provide [an overview of the platform's technical development](https://github.com/rahvaalgatus/rahvaalgatus/issues) and [Rahvaalgatus.ee general activities](https://kogu.ee/rahvaalgatusveeb).
Rahvaalgatus.ee was a finalist in [The Innovation in Politics Awards](https://innovationinpolitics.eu/) 2023 competition and was nominated as the [best open data re-user](https://medium.com/digiriik/eesti-avaandmete-valdkonna-silmapaistvad-panustajad-2023-1f353177c0b0) in the 2023 competition by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications.
