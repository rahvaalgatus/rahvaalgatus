<strong>The European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) is a similar mechanism to Rahvaalgatus, but with an opportunity to shape <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> policy instead.</strong> Directly participating in the development of EU policies is the right of all EU citizens — whether it be by creating, joining or giving your signature to an initiative.

What is the European Citizens' Initiative?
-------------------------------
The ECI is a unique way for you to help shape the EU by calling on the European Commission to propose new laws. Once an initiative has reached **1 million signatures**, the Commission will decide on what action to take. 

Since **May 9, 2012**, when the first initiative was registered, a total of **89 initiatives** have been created, out of which 6 have successfully reached the signature threshold and have gotten an answer from the European Commission. In total EU citizens have given over **16 million** signatures.

What can you achieve?
---------------------------
Once you have collected 1 million signatures, you will meet the representatives of the European Commission and present your initiative at a public hearing at the European Parliament. The Commission is **obliged** to respond to it and spell out what action it will propose in response to your initiative (if any), and its reasons for taking (or not taking) action.

Even if your initiative will not reach the signature threshold, the mobilisation of thousands of people can still bring about change. For example the [Single Communication Tariff Act](https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/initiatives/details/2012/000016_en), which failed to reach 1 million signatures in 2013, helped launch a dialogue that led to the abolition of roaming charges in the EU in 2017.

How to create an initiative?
---------------------
1. You must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in 7 different EU countries (citizenship does not have to be different). To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.

2. Before you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the European Commission to register it. The Commission will then assess whether it meets the necessary criteria and whether the proposal falls within an area of competence of the Commission.

3. After the initiative is registered and you are ready to launch your campaign, you must set a kick-off date, when you start collecting signatures.


What happens next?
---------------
After your initiative has reached a **million signatures**, the signatures must be sent to the competent authorities in each EU country and after the verification process is complete, the initiative will be forwarded to the European Commission.

1. **Within one month** you will meet with representatives of the Commission so you can explain the issues raised in your initiative in detail.
2. **Within three months** you will have the opportunity to present your initiative at a public hearing at the European Parliament. The Parliament may also hold a debate in a full (plenary) session, which could lead to it adopting a resolution related to your issue.
3. **Within six months** the Commission will spell out what action it will propose in response to your initiative (if any), and its reasons for taking (or not taking) action. This response will be in the form of a communication formally adopted by the Commissioners and published in all official EU languages.

The Estonian Cooperation Assembly's democracy expert is the European Citizens’ Initiative ambassador who contributes to spreading the word about the ECI in Estonia.  The ambassadors come from a wide range of organisations active at European, national or regional level, and they all have something in common – expertise in participatory democracy and a common goal to encourage citizens’ involvement in policy-making.
