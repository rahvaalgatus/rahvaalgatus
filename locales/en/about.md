## <a id="tos"></a> Terms of using the Rahvaalgatus.ee platform

Rahvaalgatus.ee is meant for co-creating proposals and submitting them to the Parliament of Estonia or any one of the local governments in Estonia. The proposal should aim at **improving the society** or **amending existing regulations**. 

The terms of use are compiled in good faith that argumented discussions help to create good proposals and initiatives, which in turn help to improve the life and participatory democracy in Estonia. **You can collect signatures for your proposal for a maximum of 18 months**

**A collective proposal process corresponds with our good practice standards if:**

1. the initiative is based on the relevant laws of the [Parliament](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/512032015002/consolide#para152b9) or [local government](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/530082021001/consolide);
2. it is a constructive proposal which outlines the problem and the solution;
3. the initiative does not include profanities, calls for physical violence or spread slander against specific individuals;
4. it is written in Estonian. Our platform lets people add English and Russian translations to garner support from non-Estonian speakers, but the official proposal has to be in Estonian;
5. for the sake of transparency, all organizations that are affiliated with the initiative are mentioned (lobbying organizations, political parties, non-governmental organizations, companies etc);
6. the author of the initiative considers the arguments and amendment proposals of others before they send the proposal to gather signatures;
7. the commentators refrain from comments that contain profanity or slander;
8. the author of the proposal understands that they are responsible for representing the interests of the signatories in the local government or Riigikogu and are willing to do so.

Rahvaalgatus.ee is **not open for hate speech**. The moderator of Rahvaalgatus.ee - the Estonian Cooperation Assembly - takes a democratic approach and opts for suggestions and recommendations instead of censoring, but **has the right to remove any kind of post and entry violating the terms of use**, without giving any further explanation. 

If you need help or you hesitate whether Rahvaalgatus.ee is the proper platform for submitting your proposal, please contact info@rahvaalgatus.ee. We recommend Parliament members and parties to use the tools already at their disposal, instead of this participatory democracy portal.


## Processing of personal data
Personal data are data relating to the user that are entered on the platform of Rahvaalgatus.ee. The user of rahvaalgatus.ee will grant the administrator of the platform the right to disclose, process and maintain the entered personal data. If the user wishes to cease the public disclosure, processing and maintenance of personal data by rahvaalgatus.ee, then rahvaalgatus.ee will enable the user to delete his/her user account and all data relating to it.

The user account must be created in order to initiate the motion and provide commentaries.

**There is no need to create a user account to give an endorsement signature.**

By giving an endorsement signature, name and personal ID-code are saved. The user can log in and download or delete his/her signature(s) at any time when the initiative is still in the signing phase. This will not be possible after the proposal has been sent to the Riigikogu/local government.
The list of people who have granted their endorsement signatures is visible to authorised employees of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu who ensure that digital signatures have been given by permanent residents of Estonia who are at least 16 years of age. In the case of local governments the signatures will be verified by the authorised official, who checks the validity of digital signatures and confirms that the signatories are registered to live in that municipality.

In order to keep rahvaalgatus.ee running, **the Estonian Cooperation Assembly collects donations**. The payment intermediary and the authorized data processor is Maksekeskus AS, to which the personal data necessary for making payments are forwarded.

If a person finds that his or her rights have been unreasonably restricted or violated, he or she has the right to apply to the Data Protection Inspectorate or a court.
