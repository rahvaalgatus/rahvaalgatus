# About

The Citizen Initiative Portal Rahvaalgatus.ee enables you to **write proposals**, hold discussions, compose and send digitally signed collective addresses to the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) and the local government. At Rahvaalgatus.ee you can submit a proposal on how to amend existing regulations or improve the society. A collective address sent to the Riigikogu should have **at least 1000 signatures** in support, given by at least 16 year old citizens of Estonia. For the local government the collective address needs to collect the signatures of **at least 1% of its registered population**. At Rahvaalgatus.ee you can follow the proceedings of the address and see whether it will become a draft act or how the institution decides to solve the relevant problem.

Rahvaalgatus.ee uses open data from the Parliament's document registry to publish the processing information for each initiative as soon as it is made available and to notify subscribers about updates via email. In addition to using open data, Rahvaalgatus.ee has created its own [open data API](https://rahvaalgatus.ee/api), allowing advocacy organisations to keep track of the progress of initiatives related to their field. 

Collective petitioning right emerged from the People’s Assembly process – since 2014 spring every citizen can send collective initiatives to the Parliament for consideration. According to the law, the Parliament will have to process appeals that have at least 1000 signatures. There has been over **two hundred** collective proposals that have reached the Parliament since 2014. Starting from 2016 citizens can practice their right using Rahvaalgatus.ee and starting from August 2020 citizens can also send proposals to their local government.

## <a id="tos"></a> Terms of using the Rahvaalgatus.ee platform

Rahvaalgatus.ee is meant for co-creating proposals and submitting them to the Parliament of Estonia or any one of the local governments in Estonia. The proposal should aim at **improving the society** or **amending existing regulations**. 

The terms of use are compiled in good faith that argumented discussions help to create good proposals and initiatives, which in turn help to improve the life and participatory democracy in Estonia. **You can collect signatures for your proposal for a maximum of 18 months**

**A collective proposal process corresponds with our good practice standards if:**

1. the initiative is based on the relevant laws of the [Parliament](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/512032015002/consolide#para152b9) or [local government](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/530082021001/consolide);
2. it is a constructive proposal which outlines the problem and the solution;
3. the initiative does not include profanities, calls for physical violence or spread slander against specific individuals;
4. it is written in Estonian. Our platform lets people add English and Russian translations to garner support from non-Estonian speakers, but the official proposal has to be in Estonian;
5. for the sake of transparency, all organizations that are affiliated with the initiative are mentioned (lobbying organizations, political parties, non-governmental organizations, companies etc);
6. the author of the initiative considers the arguments and amendment proposals of others before they send the proposal to gather signatures;
7. the commentators refrain from comments that contain profanity or slander;
8. the author of the proposal understands that they are responsible for representing the interests of the signatories in the local government or Riigikogu and are willing to do so.

The moderator of Rahvaalgatus.ee - the Estonian Cooperation Assembly - takes a democratic approach and opts for suggestions and recommendations instead of censoring, but **has the right to remove any kind of post and entry violating the terms of use**, without giving any further explanation. 

Rahvaalgatus.ee is not responsible for the content of the initiatives or the comments given to them.

If you need help or you hesitate whether Rahvaalgatus.ee is the proper platform for submitting your proposal, please contact info@rahvaalgatus.ee. We recommend Parliament members and parties to use the tools already at their disposal, instead of this participatory democracy portal.


## Processing of personal data
Personal data are data relating to the user that are entered on the platform of Rahvaalgatus.ee. The user of Rahvaalgatus.ee will grant the administrator of the platform the right to disclose, process and maintain the entered personal data. The data controller is SA Eesti Koostöö Kogu which is also the administrator of Rahvaalgatus.ee. If the user wishes to cease the public disclosure, processing and maintenance of personal data by Rahvaalgatus.ee, then Rahvaalgatus.ee will enable the user to delete his/her user account and all data relating to it.

**The user account must be created in order to create the initiative and provide commentaries.**

**There is no need to create a user account to give an endorsement signature.**

By giving an endorsement signature, name, personal ID-code, time of signing, approximate location and cryptographic signature are saved. The user can log in and download or delete his/her signature(s) at any time when the initiative is still in the signing phase. This will not be possible after the proposal has been sent to the Riigikogu/local government.

If the initiative has collected enough signatures to be sent to the Riigikogu or local government and the initiator has decided to forward it to the relevant institution, the digital signatures will be sent to the Riigikogu or the relevant local government together with the text of the initiative.

The list of people who have given their signatures is visible to the authorised employees of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu who ensure that digital signatures have been given by permanent residents of Estonia who are at least 16 years of age. In the case of local governments the signatures will be verified by the authorised official, who checks the validity of digital signatures and confirms that the signatories are registered to live in that municipality.

Data is processed in the Riigikogu only for the submission of the collective appeal and in local governments only for the submission of the initiative. The processing is carried out based on the general personal data processing requirements and in Riigikogu on the basis of the Response to Memoranda and Requests for Explanations and Submission of Collective Proposals Act Chapter 3. In local government on the basis of Local Government Organisation Act § 32.

**Signatures can be collected for a maximum of 18 months.** This is how long the signatures given to the initiative are stored. When this time expires or earlier, if the initiative collects signatures faster and it is submitted to the relevant institution, personal data will be removed from the signatures. This means that the cryptographic signature is deleted and only the first 3 digits of the personal code (gender and year of birth of the signer), time of signing, approximate location and reference to the initiative are retained. It is possible to issue statistics based on anonymized data. 

Data is kept confidential and all persons who have the right to process personal data have been informed of the confidential nature of personal data. People who have signed the initiative are not publicly displayed by Rahvaalgatus.ee.

In order to keep Rahvaalgatus.ee running, **the Estonian Cooperation Assembly collects donations**. The payment intermediary and the authorized data processor is Maksekeskus AS, to which the personal data necessary for making payments are forwarded.

If a person finds that his or her rights have been unreasonably restricted or violated, he or she has the right to apply to the Data Protection Inspectorate or a court.

We will notify the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate of the breach without undue delay and, if possible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to pose a major threat to the rights and freedoms of a natural person. In the event of a major threat to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, we inform the data subject so that they can take the necessary measures immediately.
