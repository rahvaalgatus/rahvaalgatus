Estonia is truly a unique place. There are dozens of services that can be accessed without leaving your home or from abroad. To participate in these services, it is sufficient that you have a digital identity that can be used via an **ID-card**, **Mobile-ID** or **Smart-ID**. With them, you can securely identify yourself for digital services, as well as give your digital signature digitally to confirm agreements or consents. 

**PIN1** is your daily companion for entering all kinds of digital environments by identifying yourself with it.  
**PIN2** is your digital signature and by entering it you give your consent, make a commitment or in the case of Rahvaalgatus.ee express a position for or against something. The digital signature must be given thoughtfully.

Similarly to a driving school, where safe practice starts on a closed lot, we have created this safe electronic signature sandbox. Here you can try giving a digital signature via **ID-card**, **Mobile-ID** and **Smart-ID** in a safe environment and download your signature later as well.
