## Give your signature

Below you will find different solutions for giving your digital signature. You can choose the one that suits you best or why not try all the options.

- To give your signature using an **ID-card**, insert the card into the card reader. Make sure the card is facing the right way and press the **ID card** button below. The window that opens will ask you for a **digital signature or PIN2**. 
- To give your signature with a **Mobile-ID**, press the **Mobile-ID** button below. Next, you will be asked for both your mobile number and personal identification code. After entering them, you can press the **SIGN WITH MOBILE-ID** button. 
- To give your signature with a **Smart-ID**, press the **Smart-ID** button. By clicking on it, you will be asked for a personal code, after entering it you can press the **SIGN WITH SMART-ID** button.

Choose the one you prefer and give it a try! 

The system creates a downloadable [file](/demo-signatures/signable), for you that contains the sentence "My first digital signature." with your digital signature attached to it.
